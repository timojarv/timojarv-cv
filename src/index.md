### About
I am a 17-year-old developer and technology
enthusiast from Finland.
I have experience with a wide variety of programming languages
and I'm always eager to learn new things.

Apart from programming and technology, my hobbies include
going to the gym, occasional photography, watching films
and reading books. I'm the kind of person who gets stuff done
and doesn't give up easily.

Currently I am studying and working as an entrepreneur, building web apps and sites for various
clients. I have also given lectures and consultation on social media.
