### About
I am a 19-year-old full-stack developer and technology
enthusiast from Finland.
I have experience with a wide variety of programming languages
and technologies and I'm always eager to learn new things as well.

Apart from programming and technology, my hobbies include
going to the gym and occasional photography.
I'm the kind of person who gets stuff done and doesn't give up easily.

I have worked as an entrepreneur, building websites and applications for various clients.
In the future I will be studying Industrial Engineering and Management (tuotantotalous) in the Tampere University of Technology.
